# Installation Instructions
* Put all these files inside `\portable_config` in your mpv installation folder. If no such directory exists create one.

  For example if you installed mpv at `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv` then download and extract these files to `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv\portable_config`.
