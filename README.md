# Installation Instructions
* Put all these files inside `\portable_config` in your mpv installation folder. If no such directory exists create one.

  For example if you installed mpv at `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv` then download and extract these files to `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv\portable_config`.

  * [autosubsync](https://github.com/joaquintorres/autosubsync-mpv)
  * [autosub.lua](https://github.com/davidde/mpv-autosub)
  * [mpvcord](https://github.com/yutotakano/mpvcord) (there is nothing to configure here for basic functionality but some additional files from discord are required tho, check their readme to know more)
  * [mpv-remote-node](https://github.com/husudosu/mpv-remote-node)
