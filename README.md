My personal mpv config (Tested on Windows Only).
# Requirements
Download and install all these and add them to your [path](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/).

# Installation Instructions
* Put all these files inside `\portable_config` in your mpv installation folder. If no such directory exists create one.

  For example if you installed mpv at `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv` then download and extract these files to `D:\Program Files (x86)\mpv\portable_config`.

* Edit the following scripts/folders and read their respective readme to see how to properly configure them for your system:

  * [autosub.lua](https://github.com/davidde/mpv-autosub)
  * [mpvcord](https://github.com/yutotakano/mpvcord) (there is nothing to configure here for basic functionality but some additional files from discord are required tho, check their readme to know more)
